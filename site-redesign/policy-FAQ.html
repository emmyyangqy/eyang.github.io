                <h4>How Red Moth Works:</h4>
                <p>Red Moth pieces are made in small batches, known as collections. Collections are theme-based and are created over the course of several weeks. Collections are dropped on a specified date and time, which can typically found in Red Moth's social media bios, such as Instagram and TikTok. Pieces are not listed before the collection drop. At the exact date/time of the collection drop, the entire collection is listed on the website, and it is first come, first serve. Shopify does not reserve carts, so whoever completes checkout first, receives the item. I do not have any control over this, and I do not hold/reserve items to ensure that it is completely fair to everyone. It is recommended to set a reminder of collection drops, especially if there is a piece you would like to buy. Pieces often go very quickly, some within minutes or hours. Once a piece is sold out, no more will be made. Unfortunately, because pieces sell out within minutes, my website is often sparse- sometimes for weeks at a time. This is because I am working on made-to-order pieces of the latest collection or designing pieces for a new collection. Often times, when you see a Red Moth piece being made on social media, but not listed, it is most likely because it is being made for a future collection. Everything is handmade with intention and care, so collections take quite a long time to be made. If you have any questions, feel free to email or DM me. </p>

                <h4>Shipping:</h4>
                <p>Please allow for at least 5 business days processing time before shipping of orders. Please allow for at least 3 weeks processing time before shipping of custom-sized made-to-order pieces. Tracking information is provided at the time of shipping to the email provided during checkout.  Please contact USPS to file a claim if your package does not arrive, as once it is dropped off at the post office, it is out of my control. Please contact me if you have an issue with your piece immediately upon arrival. At this point in time, Red Moth Jewelry only ships to the US. We will be working on opening up international shipping in the near future.</p>
                
                <h4>Made-to-Orders: </h4>
                <p>Made-to-order pieces take at least 3 weeks to be made and shipped. Please note that as these are all handmade pieces, slight variations in size, shape, and color of stones and details may occur. Once all made-to-order pieces of a design have been sold, the sample piece will be listed for purchase. I will not resize sample pieces.</p>

                <h4>Sizing:</h4>
                <p>I am not responsible for replacing or resizing rings that do not fit. Please know your ring size before ordering. All chain lengths are final and will not be altered. Wrist cuffs are made to the standard wrist cuff size and fits most wrists.</p>

                <h4>Custom Orders:</h4>
                <p>I do not take custom orders or design requests. I will keep everyone updated if I decide to open up spots for custom orders.</p>

                <h4>Sold Out Pieces:</h4>
                <p>I do not typically restock old, sold-out pieces. I do like to gauge interest for specific designs and potentially revisit them in future collections. Feel free to leave social media comments letting me know what designs you miss and would like to see versions of again! </p>

                <h4>Refunds/Returns:</h4>
                <p>Please contact me if you are unhappy with your piece. I will do my best to reasonably work with you to make your Red Moth experience an enjoyable one. </p>

                <h4>Handmade Quality:</h4>
                <p>All Red Moth Jewelry pieces are hand-made by a single person. Please be aware that because these pieces are completely fabricated by hand, there can be charming imperfections. If you are looking for factory-perfection, Red Moth Jewelry pieces may not be right for you.<p>

                <h4>Jewelry Care:</h4>
                <p> Red Moth Jewelry is handmade, thus not indestructible. I aim to make my jewelry to last, but gemstones and metal are still prone to damage. Please handle and wear with care. Sterling silver and brass tarnish easily, but it's nothing to stress about! In order to protect your jewelry from tarnish, discoloration, or long-term damage: Avoid wearing jewelry while doing strenuous activities, crafts, or chores. Avoid wearing your jewelry while using harsh chemicals or cleaners. Avoid storing your jewelry in direct sunlight. Avoid wearing jewelry when putting on makeup or perfumes - put your jewelry on last when getting ready. Wear your jewelry often! The natural oils in your skin help prevent tarnish. Clean jewelry with mild soap, warm water, and a soft brush (an old toothbrush works great.) As your sterling silver collection grows, consider keeping a polishing cloth with your jewelry. I provide a small, complimentary polishing cloth with each order. These can be reused several times before the polishing agent is exhausted. For larger jewelry collections, larger polishing cloths are recommended. A good, reasonably-priced brand is Sunshine Radiant polishing cloths. They are available at several retailers, including Amazon.</p>

                <h4>Repairs:</h4>
                <p>I do not do repairs on any sentimental, premade, or heirloom jewelry. I will repair Red Moth Jewelry pieces (within reason) if it broke due to the structural integrity of the piece, and not careless wear. Please contact me with any questions or concerns about your Red Moth piece.</p>

                <h4>General information:</h4>
                <p>I am a one-person show and do my best to handle everything promptly and positively. Please be patient in waiting for a response or your pieces. While I do my best to handle everything in a timely manner, sometimes life happens. My goal is to make your Red Moth Jewelry experience a positive one. </p>

                <br>

                <h4 class="red italic">By purchasing a Red Moth Jewelry piece, you are confirming that you have read Red Moth Jewelryâ€™s policies and understand the terms and conditions that go along with your purchase.</h4>

            <div style="padding-left: 200px; padding-right: 200px;">
                <div class="faq">
                    <div class="question">Q: Why is your website always sold out?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A: I make pieces in small batches, known as collections. Collections are dropped at a specified date and time, and often sell out within minutes. Due to limited materials and time, I cannot keep designs stocked infinitely. Once things are sold out, I do not make more. It takes several weeks to make a collection from start to finish, so unfortunately, my website is often sparse as I'm designing pieces for a new collection. The best way to grab a Red Moth piece you see on social media is to set an alarm/reminder for the exact date/time of a collection drop. This will give you the best chance of getting the piece that you want. I do my best to work as quickly as possible to make new pieces, but because everything is handmade to the highest quality I can produce, things simply just take time and are limited. </div>
            
                    <div class="question">Q: Do you do custom designs?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A: No, I do not do customs or take requests for custom designs. Time for extra projects is very limited, and in order to fuel my creativity, I reserve all my time to designing for collections.</div>
            
                    <div class="question">Q: I saw a piece on TikTok/Instagram, but it's not on your website. Is it for sale?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A: Most likely, yes, it will be for sale. Most pieces I show being made on social media are for a future collection. While it is not listed on the website, it will be listed at the exact date/time of the collection drop, typically found in my social media bios. The rare occasion that a piece is not for sale is if it is a made-to-order piece from the last collection, or if it is being made as a gift for someone, which is typically specified. </div>

                    <div class="question">Q: I saw you post a piece on social media that I love. I really want it and am willing to pay for it now. Do you reserve or sell pieces before a collection drop? </div>
                    <div class="answer">A: No, I do not reserve pieces or sell them before a collection drop. In order to maintain fairness to all of my customers, I only sell pieces starting on the collection drop. Then, it's first come, first served. </div>

                    <div class="question">Q: It's launch day, but your website but is locked. Do I need a password to get into the website for the collection launch?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A: No! I lock my website on launch day as I'm listing pieces, designing, and finalizing everything. The website will automatically unlock at exactly the specified time of the collection launch. Typically if you're hanging out on the website, there will be a countdown until the website unlocks. Once the countdown hits zero, you will need to refresh the page in order for the site to unlock correctly.  </div>

                    <div class="question">Q: I had a piece in my cart and was checking out, but then it said it was no longer available. What happened? </div>
                    <div class="answer">A: Unfortunately, Shopify does not reserve carts, meaning you and someone else can add the same item, and whoever completes checkout first, gets the item. It does not matter who put the item in their cart first. Red Moth has no control over this, and due to limited pieces, things tend to go quite quickly. I always recommend setting an alarm/reminder on your phone and hopping on immediately at launch time for best chances of getting your desired piece. Unfortunately, I cannot make any promises that this will ensure you get what you want.</div>

                    <div class="question">Q: What's the best way for me to try and get a piece on launch day? </div>
                    <div class="answer">A: I always recommend setting alarms or reminders for a collection launch day. Setting up a ShopPay account with your shipping address, billing address, and credit card information beforehand can save time at checkout. When adding an item to your cart, you can pay with the "Pay with ShopPay" option, and all of your information is prepared and ready to go! </div>

                    <div class="question">Q: How do I find my ring size? </div>
                    <div class="answer">A: Your local jewelry shop can measure your ring size, many times complimentarily. You can also invest $5 in a ring sizer at many retailers, including Amazon. </div>

                    <div class="question">Q: What does "MTO" in a product title mean? </div>
                    <div class="answer">A: If a product has "MTO" in the title, it means the product is made-to-order. These products are made AFTER the order is placed. These products take at least three weeks to be made and shipped.  </div>

                    <div class="question">Q: I want to get into metalsmithing, where do I start? </div>
                    <div class="answer">A: Start by looking into local metalsmithing classes. You can also look into literature that that teaches you how to metalsmith. I love the book "Metalsmithing for Jewelry Makers" by McGrath. There are also tons of YouTube videos and classes that are very helpful to learn. @MetalSmithSociety on Instagram is a great resource and offers lots of tips to learn the trade, including tool lists and links on where to buy them. </div>

                    <div class="question">Q: Where do you order supplies?</div>
                    <div class="answer">A: I order most of my jewelry making supplies off Rio Grande, Pepe tools, Amazon, and my local hardware stores. Stones are typically bought from local lapidaries, local gem & mineral shows, and trusted online vendors.</div>
